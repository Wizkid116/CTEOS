# CTEOS
Unofficial CTE Linux distro installation script based on LFS (WIP)

## TODO (ALSO WIP)
* check for dependencies

* create $LFS and $BLD variables

* ask where to build, then create neccesary filesystems there

* download source files

* function for extracting source file, sourcing config and compile instructions, then running it

* create directories and chroot
build the rest, configure and compile the kernel, set everything up, and exit
cleanup
* ask for system hostname, password, user, and network interface, then carry those to the new environment
